# Slow Food Madness
Reserve your Pizza at the nearest restaurant.

Full working demo project using the following technologies:

* Java 8
* Dropwizard
* HTML5
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* MongoDB
* Groovy
* Spock
* Gradle

This is a slightly revised and updated version of the incredible tutorial from Trisha Gee that I used to try and learn new technologies.

### Steps for the execution of the demo:

1. Install and Run MongoDB
2. Load the DB executing the Groovy Script ```PopulateDatabase.groovy```
3. Run the class ```RestaurantWithPizzaApplication``` as a Java Application
4. Go to the URL ```http://localhost:8080/restaurant.html```

For the explanation I strongly suggest to watch one of the videos from Trisha.
